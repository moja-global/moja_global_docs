## How to Set Up the Documentation Website Locally?

In order to set up the documentation website locally, make sure you have a [Github](https://github.com) account. If you do not have an existing Github account, we recommend you to create one.

Here are the steps you can follow while setting up the documentation locally.

1. Fork the repository.

2. Clone the repository with the following command. Replace the <GITHUB_USERNAME> with your username.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<GITHUB_USERNAME>/moja_global_docs.git
```

3. Next, go to the directory containing the project.

```sh
cd moja_global_docs
```

4. Navigate to the docs directory

```sh
cd docs
```

Make sure you already have python and pip installed before setting up the documentation.

#### For **Linux** Users:

```sh
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
make html
```

#### For **Windows** Users:

```sh
virtualenv env
env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
make html
```

You can now run the documentation site on `_build/html/index.html` in your browser. In order to update the documentation after making corresponding changes, run `make clean && make html`.
