Moja global documentation
=========================

Welcome to the official moja global documentation. You will be introduced 
to the moja global projects and can start exploring their features.

Moja global is an open-source platform. It provides tools for
estimating emissions and removals of greenhouse gases from the land
sector. It is composed of multiple GitHub repositories designed to
ingest, aggregate, and serve data.

The Full Lands INtegration Tool (FLINT) is the flagship software
developed by the moja global community. It is an integrating platform
for estimating land-based greenhouse gas emissions and removals.
Integrating refers to FLINTâ€™s design to combine a wide range of data
with models to achieve more accurate estimates of stocks and fluxes of
greenhouse gases. FLINT is consistent with the UNFCCC guidelines.
