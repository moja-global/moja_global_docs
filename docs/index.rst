Moja global documentation
=========================

moja global is an open-source platform that provides tools for
estimating emissions and removals of greenhouse gases from the land
sector. It’s composed of multiple GitHub repositories designed to
ingest, aggregate, and serve data.

The Full Lands INtegration Tool (FLINT) is the flagship software
developed by the moja global community. It is an integrating platform
for estimating land-based greenhouse gas emissions and removals.
Integrating refers to FLINT’s design to combine a wide range of data
with models to achieve more accurate estimates of stocks and fluxes of
greenhouse gases. FLINT is consistent with the UNFCCC guidelines.

This Documentation is meant for all and developers wishing to contribute
to moja global repositories. If you would like to get in touch with the
maintainers for other reasons, please drop a mail at info@moja.global.
