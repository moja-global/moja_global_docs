Investigating the GCBM Inputs
=============================

The GCBM inputs mainly consist of spatial data that comes in geoTIFF and their corresponding JSON files. 
To access these files, you need to download the GCBM_Demo_Run zip folder from the `FLINT.Cloud`_ repository and navigate into the layers/tiled folder.
