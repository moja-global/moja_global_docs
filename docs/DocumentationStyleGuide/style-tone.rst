Style & Tone
===========

We aim to achieve a simple, easy-to-understand context for our technical
and non-technical documentation. It aims to overlook the too-formal or
robotic tone and give way to a friendly, inclusive and respectful tone
of communication. It should call to action in a casual and approachable
tone and should not sound pushy or dry.

As a Technical Writer, if you are using an entertaining tone to help the
readers better understand, do not go over the humour part. We generally
assume that not every humour piece is universal and can be interpreted
differently across different regions.

A few guidelines are employed to understand the style and tone. These
are entirely flexible and are not universal for every context that we
share amongst ourselves.

Approaches to be considered
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Use Active voice wherever possible.
-  The style and tone should be friendly and come off as natural.
-  Making use of transaction words is quite preferred, to denote something
   related to a process or other action.
-  Simplify the documentation hierarchy for the readers to easily
   follow.
-  Technical terms, abbreviations, jargon should be documented early on
   in the document.
-  Brief, concise statements are preferred over wordy sentences.
-  Documentation pieces should be proofread by a peer or a fellow
   contributor.
-  Gender-neutral pronouns must be used for overall inclusivity.

Approaches to be not considered
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Using gender-specific and culture-specific terminologies and figures
   of speech.
-  Using biased, unconfirmed or pre-assumed information pieces.
-  Using pretentious language to convince the reader of a fact or
   understanding. For example, *This is the best way to do it*, even though
   there is no supporting evidence to convince the reader about the same.
-  Using ableist language that is offensive to a group of people or
   community.
-  Being too polite; Avoid using words like *“please”* as it betrays the
   instructional nature of documentation.
-  Unnecessary capitalization, exclamation and use of abbreviations.

Apart from this, we heavily focus our documentation on two groups of
people: users and developers. The users are researchers, scientists and
government entities who use moja global projects to drive the
decision-making process. The developers are community members who work
on engineering, documentation, UI/UX designing and management to drive
the projects at moja global forward.

We have some recommended practices involved while writing the
documentation for these two groups:

For user-based documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While writing user-based documentation, we should consider that many of
them may not be native English speakers. Hence using strong words,
technical jargon, abbreviations may not be very suited for a
documentation piece. The guidelines in this case are:

-  Maintain a clear and concise knowledge transfer from the
   documentation to the user.
-  Use short and crisp sentences that make easy sense to a user.
-  Use paragraphs to share a single context with the user. Avoid
   mixing multiple contexts in the same paragraph.
-  Consistent vocabulary and phrasing are of the utmost need here.
-  Actively consider using software or a tool to measure the
   readability. We suggest using `readability`_ and `write good`_ to improve
   readability.

For developer-based documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While writing developer-based documentation, you can follow the same
style as in the user-based documentation. You can assume the technical
competency of the reader by putting prerequisites and a high-level
overview of the technology you wish to cover. Some of the guidelines
are:

-  Use instructive language to convey technical details and steps.
-  Avoid jumping the bandwagon while documenting technical steps.
-  Avoid using a conversational tone while documenting code and software
   references.
-  Use *the second person* while keeping the emphasis on the reader.
   For example, *In this section, the user will run a module on their local
   machine to get the results* is wrong. Prefer refactoring it into, *In
   this section, you will run a module on your local machine to get the
   results.*
-  Verify the documentation piece with a Subject Matter Expert (SME)
   before publishing.
