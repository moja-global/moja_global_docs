Moja global documentation style guide
=====================================

The moja global style guide specifies rules and standards to create
developer and end-user documentation across the moja global projects.
The style guide aims for simplicity and flexibility while documenting
the length and breadth of the technical and user-facing details that
concerns the overall documentation development in moja global. The
primary objective of the style guide is to help the documentation
writers and information developers maintain the style and consistency
across all our projects while facilitating uniformity.

Purpose
-------

Moja global’s style guide serves the following purpose for our
contributors and end-users:

-  Our style guide covers specific areas around grammatical, syntactical
   and content format. The rules and guidelines are not strict but
   informative.
-  The primary purpose of the style guide isn’t to enforce decisions of
   being right or wrong. It’s more about finding compatibility among
   existing documentation pieces and maintaining a standard.
-  The style guide is flexible and open to changes. The documentation
   context is another factor to shape the information.
-  The foremost importance is given to the clarity and the meaning of
   the documentation piece. The style guide should be just trusted as a
   standard to keep the documentation consistent.
-  Every documentation piece is developed with accessibility and
   inclusivity. We at moja global serve a global audience of developers,
   writers, scientists and users. We strive to make our project
   accessible for all.

Tools & Technologies
--------------------

At moja global, we use a variety of tools and technologies to document
our products and services.

We use Markdown and reStructured documentation to document our products
and services. Markdown is a markup language that allows us to write
formatted text. We use `GitHub flavoured Markdown`_, `MDX`_ and
`reStructuredText`_ among our version-control projects. We use
`Google Docs`_ and `HackMD`_ to collaborate internally and share
feedback among the documentation development teams before pushing it to
GitHub.

These tools are easy to learn and pick up. You can refer to open-source
tutorials and guides on the same to pick them up fairly quickly. If you
have any questions or doubts, please ask your peer or your mentor in the
community to help you out.
