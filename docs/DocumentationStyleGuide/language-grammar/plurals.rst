Language & Grammar VII: Plurals
===============================

Plurals of most words, abbreviations, letters, and numbers can be done
by adding a letter *s* alone. Knowing when to use plural or singular nouns
can be confusing. It is best to keep it simple by not referring to more than
one object in a sentence.

For the singular and the plural nouns that donâ€™t end with the letter
*s,* you can form an apostrophe to provide a clear and to-point
understanding. Some general guidelines for the usage are:

-  Do not use the letter *s* for product names, tools, technologies, and
   interfaces.
-  Use an apostrophe and the letter *s* for plurals of single letters.
-  Usage of apostrophes to form plurals of abbreviations should be
   avoided.
-  Avoid adding (s) to indicate the plural form of a word or a variable.
