Language & Grammar VII: Plurals
===============================

Plurals of most words, abbreviations, letters, and numbers can be done
by adding a letter *s* alone. Plural *versus* singular is a common topic
for many writers (and readers) to get confused at. It is always advised
to reduce the risk of ambiguity by not referring to more than one object
when an object class is in the question.

For the singular and the plural nouns that donâ€™t end with the letter
*s,* you can form an apostrophe to provide a clear and to-point
understanding. Some general guidelines for the usage are:

-  Do not use the letter *s* for product names, tools, technologies, and
   interfaces.
-  Use an apostrophe and the letter *s* for plurals of single letters.
-  Usage of apostrophes to form plurals of abbreviations should be
   avoided.
-  Avoid adding (s) to indicate the plural form of a word or a variable.
