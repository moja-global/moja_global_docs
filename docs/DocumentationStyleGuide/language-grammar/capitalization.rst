Language & Grammar III: Capitalization
======================================

At moja global, we use both sentence case and headline-style
capitalization, depending on the context. Predominantly, we strive to
follow sentence case capitalization where we capitalize only the initial
letter of the first word in the text and other words that require
capitalization.

The guidelines in this case are:

-  Capitalize the first word of a sentence, the first word in a
   subheading after a colon and proper nouns.
-  Donâ€™t look forward to capitalizing the words unnecessarily, even if
   they look good.
-  If a sentence starts with lowercase, rephrase it to format it as per
   the sentence case.
-  Use sentence case, for forms, text in tables, figures and headings.
-  Headline style capitalization should be employed as per the context,
   like blog posts, research paper titles to use initial uppercase
   letters for all significant words in the text.
-  More detailed explanation on sentence case:
      - In sentence case, lowercase most words in a title or heading. Capitalize only the following words:
         - The first word of the title or heading
         - The first word of a subtitle
         - The first word after a colon, em dash, or end punctuation in a heading
         - Nouns followed by numerals or letters
         - Proper nouns (such as the names of racial or ethnic groups)
