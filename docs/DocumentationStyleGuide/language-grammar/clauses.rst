Language & Grammar IV: Clauses
==============================

As a technical writer, you have to handle conditional statements that
comprise clauses carefully. A conditional statement contains a main
clause and a conditional clause. Here, the *if-clause* clause is the
conditional clause, and it may come before or next to the main clause.

The guidelines are:

-  Use a colon between two independent clauses to signify their
   relationship.
-  Use a semicolon to separate independent clauses with internal
   punctuation.
-  Do not remove the verb if you use two coordinate clauses from the
   latter clause.
-  Use conditional clauses after main clauses or the introductions.
