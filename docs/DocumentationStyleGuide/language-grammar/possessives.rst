Language & Grammar VIII: Possessives
====================================

We use the possessive form of a singular or plural noun to highlight
ownership. We use the letter *s* as part of the usage, where it provides
an immediate context. If you would like to form a single possessive, add
an apostrophe-s. Some general guidelines for the usage are:

-  Avoid using apostrophes with possessive pronouns.
-  Avoid using the possessive form of an entity to denote the projects
   or products in the line (example: *Moja global’s FLINT* should be
   avoided).
-  Plurals ending with *s* won’t need an additional *s,* and you can add
   an apostrophe.
-  Always prefer an alternate construct if it provides a better context
   to the readers than a possessive form.
