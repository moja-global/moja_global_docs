Language & Grammar II: Articles
===============================

Using articles is always preferred in your documentation piece as it
allows the readers to concisely follow your documentation. The articles
are used to modify the nouns. Indefinite articles specify the
non-specific or non-particular nouns, while definite articles specify
the specific nouns.

While using articles we have a set of guidelines that you can follow:

-  Use a before abbreviation, word, or number that begins with a
   consonant.
-  Use before an abbreviation, word, or number that begins with a vowel.
-  Carefully use articles with abbreviations as they might pronounce
   different when spelt out.
-  Use articles to increase clarity and give a better context.
-  Use articles to distinguish between the same nouns.
