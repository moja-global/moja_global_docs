Language & Grammar VI: Direct & Indirect Speech
===============================================

Direct & indirect speech allows the readers to understand better what is
being conveyed from a previous conversation. Direct speech should be
customarily employed to quote the words spoken by someone in the context
of an event, tool, technology, or the purpose for which the
documentation is written. Breaks should not accompany it but rather
should be directly quoted without any change whatsoever.

On the other hand, indirect speech can be used to summarize or
conceptualize the words put during a conversation. We don't have to
quote it directly, and we can use verbs to denote the speaker's action
for a better context. The usage of direct and indirect speech should
provide a better context to the readers to quickly summarize the
essential details and move forward.
