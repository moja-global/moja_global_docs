Language & Grammar VI: Direct & Indirect Speech
===============================================

Direct and indirect speech allows the reader to understand better what is
being conveyed from a previous conversation. Direct speech should be
used when quoting words spoken by someone in the context
of an event, tool, technology, or the purpose for which the
documentation is written. Breaks should not accompany it but
should be directly quoted without any change.

Indirect speech can be used to summarize or
conceptualize the output of a conversation. You don't have to
quote it directly, and you can use verbs to explain the speaker's action
for better context. The usage of direct and indirect speech should
provide better context to the reader to quickly summarize the
essential details.
