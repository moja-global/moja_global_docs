Language & Grammar V: Conjunctions & Contractions
=================================================

While writing instructional content, over-using conjunctions are
detrimental. However, if you are under the impression that beginning
sentences with a conjunction would be helpful for you to make it concise
and easy to understand, you can follow it up.

Contractions are permitted in all types of content you write; however,
it is advisable to determine if they fit the context. Some general
guidelines for the usage are:

-  Avoid unconventional contractions which are not universally
   acknowledged, even if they fit the context.
-  Avoid using contractions that combine more than two words at the same
   time.
-  Avoid confusing contractions and possessiveness.
-  Avoid contractions for product names, tools, and technologies.
