Language & Grammar V: Conjunctions & Contractions
=================================================

While writing instructional content, avoid using too many conjunctions.
But do use them to help with the flow of your content.

Contractions are permitted in all types of content you write; however,
check if they are necessary and that they make sense when used.
Some general guidelines for the usage are:

-  Avoid unconventional contractions which are not universally
   acknowledged, even if they fit the context.
-  Avoid using contractions that combine more than two words at the same
   time.
-  Avoid confusing contractions and possessiveness.
-  Avoid contractions for product names, tools, and technologies.
