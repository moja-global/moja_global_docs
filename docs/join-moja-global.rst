Join the moja global family
###########################

Welcome to the moja global family! Thank you for taking the first step in connecting with us. We at moja global believe in healthy collaboration and invite you to join hands.

moja global Slack
=================

moja global Slack provides a platform for contributors to communicate, discuss ideas and ask questions. It acts as the primary communication tool used under moja global. `The moja global slack <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://join.slack.com/t/mojaglobal/shared_invite/zt-o6ta1ug0-rVLjAo460~d7JbZ~HpFFtw&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1633078795555000&usg=AFQjCNFbieFLALt9IFd9pqxYz1S54wj-Rg>`_ is also bound by our `Code Of Conduct <https://docs.moja.global/en/latest/contributing/coc.html>`_.
Make sure you follow the guidelines before posting. We encourage you to be active participants to make moja global a responsive open source organisation.

In order to receive an invite for the moja global Slack workspace, please email info@moja.global with a description of the project areas you are interested in. After evaluation from the mentors, you will receive a slack workspace invite. Please be patient since it may take time for maintainers to respond.

After joining the Slack Workspace, we encourage you to join project specific channels of your interest. You may also `answer other contributors queries <https://docs.moja.global/en/latest/contributing/ways_to_contribute.html#answer-user-questions>`_ or guide contributors towards resources in case they are stuck.

Technical Steering Committee Meetings
=====================================

The moja global team hosts a Technical Steering Committee Meeting on every 2nd Wednesday of the month. These meetings are a way for all the community members to connect, discuss progress and developments from a Technical viewpoint and engage in collaborative discussions for new/existing projects.

If you are new to the community and want to know more about moja global and meet the team, we highly encourage you to attend these meetings. Since the discussions here are not catered to a specific topic, this would be a good place to start and familiarize yourself with our community and work.
Interestingly, if you have a new idea for a project or improvements to an exisiting one, please do join these meetings and share your thoughts with us!

We also recommend all interested GSoC and other student program apsirants to join these meetings to discuss or ask their queries for any project idea that they might have. The moja global team will be sure to hear you out and provide early feedback to steer you towards your goal!

The details for all the meetings are sent out on our `Slack <https://mojaglobal.slack.com/>`_. Looking forward to seeing you in the next meeting!

Outreach and Student Programs
=============================

moja global participates in outreach and student programs regularly to welcome and provide students and under-represented communities an opportunity to work with moja global.

In the past, we’ve participated in programs like `Google Summer Of Code <https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/>`_, `Google Season Of Docs <https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs>`_ , `Linux Mentorship Programs <https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/>`_ , `Outreachy Internships <https://www.outreachy.org/>`_ and other funding and outreach programs.

Since we receive many applications through these programs, moja global encourages applicants to checkout the following guidelines to maximise chances of getting selected -

* Start early - It is encouraged for applicants to start early in the process to get a better understanding of the codebase and suggest new ideas. Many of our GSOC alums had started contributing before the application period and had active engagement in the community.

* Get in touch with us - We would love to hear your project ideas and see how they align with our current codebase. Just drop an email at ``info@moja.global`` and we will get back to you.

* Make contributions - It is highly encouraged to make contributions to the existing repositories. Often the applicants selected are the ones who have made multiple contributions throughout the application period and have stayed consistent.

* Review peer contributions - Along with making contributions, it is also encouraged to help out other community members and applicants by providing peer reviews. Code reviews also help to get a deeper understanding of the codebase.

* Stay active on `Slack <https://mojaglobal.slack.com/>`_ - Being active and friendly on slack by answering queries asked by other new contributors is another quality that moja global values and can make your application stand out.

We wish you all the best in your journey!

Most of our outreach program Alums go on to act as maintainers for their projects and mentor other new contributors in their journey.

Due to limited slots while we can't ensure selection for these programs, if you are passionate to work on the project we will definitely try to find an alternative source of funding.

moja global Outreach

Documentation working group
===========================

We are setting up a Documentation Working Group, which is primarily aimed at developing high-quality user and developer documentation. The Documentation Working group is geared towards making sure that all of the important software, tools and projects are well-documented with a standard developer experience defined to help new contributors in getting started with the community.

The Documentation Working Group is specifically used for capability building, bringing onboard new contributors, and helping them to get started, while making sure that the influx of new contributions is not hindered by a lack of good documentation.
The primary goal of the Documentation Working Group is to develop documentation for various projects under the moja global umbrella. 

However, to better understand how to connect our efforts on documentation, an understanding of how documentation is currently developed at moja global is required.

* For every project release, a new Documentation plan is created after the epic list for the release is obtained. 
* The epic list describes the bugs that were fixed, the features that were added, and all the trivial/non-trivial changes that were made that hold importance with respect to users and developers. 
* Based on the epic prioritization and bandwidths, the Documentation Working Group commits to documenting the epic list for the release.

Apart from software documentation our work is also concerned with the following:

* **Training Material**: Training materials are of utmost importance for new developers and contributors at moja global. moja global publishes its training materials over Moodle learning management system (LMS) which will be expanded over time. 

* **Website maintenance**: We love to have people with some experience in Web Development to maintain our main website and the community website. 

* **Promotion**: As part of the Documentation Working group, we work on promotional content for Social media channels that can be utilized to spread the word about moja global and how people can contribute to our initiative

* **Coordination**: The coordination effort relies on finding the resources that can help contributors which can be integrated with the documentation and coordinate the forums and mailing lists.

The Documentation Working Group is entirely driven by volunteer efforts but we like to keep track of all the contributors who would like to join.
