Simulation Units
======================

What is a Simulation Unit?
--------------------------

A Simulation Unit is a unit for which a module is applied. A Simulation
Unit can represent a spatial area, such as a pixel or forest stand, or
it can represent an emissions source, such as livestock. The Simulation
Unit refers to a geographically referenced area. It is known as a Land
Unit.

How are Simulation Units used in the FLINT?
-------------------------------------------

Within the databases and data layers underpinning the FLINT, there are
attribute values that describe the characteristics of each Simulation
Unit. For example, there may be information on the unitâ€™s area, land
type, age of vegetation, species, and carbon pools for a Land Unit. The
overall framework of FLINT manages the processing of Simulation Units
over time. While Simulation Units are the basis of all simulations run
in FLINT, they are rarely used for reporting purposes (see Local
Domain).
