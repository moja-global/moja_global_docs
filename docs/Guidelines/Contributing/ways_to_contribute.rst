=================================

There are plenty of ways you can contribute to moja global repositories.
Apart from contributing code, moja global would love any kind of help
for non-code related issues as well.

Review & Contribute Science Design
----------------------------------

Most of our code is informed by an underlying Science Design. We develop
these designs collaboratively and your contributions are most welcome!

Follow the following steps to contribute to or review a science design:

-  Find the Science Design

   -  Every moja global repository will have a folder called "Science"
      in the root directory
   -  The Science folder will contain 2 types of Science Designs:

      -  PDF files contain completed science designs.
      -  .md files contain a link to science designs under development.

   -  Locate the PDF file with the highest version number for review
   -  Locate the .md file with the highest version number for a
      contribution
   -  If no .md file is available, proceed with agree on a Science
      Design

-  Review Science Design

   -  Open the PDF file you want to review
   -  Changes or suggestions are not possible
   -  If you detect an inaccuracy or want to propose an improvement,
      check whether your change has already been made in the .md file
      with the highest version number
   -  If the change has not been made yet, continue with contribute to a
      science design below.

Suggest UI/UX Improvements

If you have ideas on how we can improve, please share them with us by

idea!

Contribute Translations
-----------------------

Right now our interfaces do not support translations and we also don't
have a translation strategy in place. But we want to change this. We
want our projects to be accessible to non-English speakers. If you have
any ideas then please share them with us by creating a `new issue`_.
