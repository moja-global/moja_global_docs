.. _contributing:

After making your first contribution
====================================

Get credit for your contribution
--------------------------------

We use the All Contributors Bot to recognize contributors.

To get recognized, just add the following line to a comment after making
your contribution (like submitting a pull request, replying to a
question, resolving an issue, etc.) :: @all-contributors please add
<@username> for <contributions>

Replace ``<@username>`` with your GitHub username and
``<contributions>`` with any word from this `list`_.

If you wish to know more about the ``all-contributors`` bot usage in
moja global, please checkout the `Bots and Integrations section`_.

Report Bugs, Provide Feedback or Request Features
-------------------------------------------------

We welcome all kinds of bug reports, user feedback and feature requests!

If you find an easily reproducible bug and/or are experienced in
reporting bugs, feel free to just open an issue on the relevant project
on GitHub.

We've created some issue templates to assist you in this. Please use
them to create a `new issue`_ in the relevant project's repository.

Pick more complex issues to work on
-----------------------------------

Now that you have your first contribution merged, you may move on to
issues without ``Good for newcomers`` and ``Help Wanted`` labels. For
specific areas of interest, please filter out the issues with specific
labels of your interest.

Help other contributors take their first step
---------------------------------------------

Now that you have made your first contribution, it is time to help other
contributors to start their journey. There are a variety of ways in
which you can help and guide them to their first contribution!

Reviewing contributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

moja global welcomes all contributors to review each others pull
requests and suggest changes. You may also choose to review other
contributions by following this guide `here`_.

Answering their queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

moja global urges all contributors and community members to help each
other out with queries on Slack/GitHub. This can help new contributors
in setting up moja global repositories and will drive the path to their
first contribution. For more details on how to answer queries, please
follow this guide
`here <https://docs.moja.global/en/master/Guidelines/Contributing/ways_to_contribute.html#answer-user-questions>`__.

Mentor new contributors
=======================

If you know the contents of the repository well and would like to help
contributors reach milestones in the development of the repository, then
you may take up the role of a **Coach** or **Ambassador** to guide and
work with new contributors. We believe this kind of healthy
collaboration can nurture young coders and provide a platform to grow
for both the parties. If you are interested, please check out this
`guide`_ to know more about these roles.

Create beginner-friendly Issues
===============================

You may also create beginner friendly issues for new contributors to
claim. Please ensure that the difficulty level of these issues are easy
and if possible can be implemented without the need for setting up the
Project completely. Since these issues are targeted at beginners, please
share all necessary details required to solve the issue (eg. Filenames
that require change) in the issue description and label the issues with
one or more of the following labels ``good-first-issue``,
``Good for newcomers`` or ``Help Wanted``.
