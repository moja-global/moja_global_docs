Git and Github guide
====================

This guide is to help new contributors set up Git, GitHub and navigate
their way through making contributions to moja global repositories. It
covers the entire process of contributing right from installing Git to
opening pull requests.

Setup this project using Git
----------------------------

Before setting up this project using Git make sure you have installed
and configured Git by following the instructions `here`_.

Fork and Clone this project
---------------------------

-  In your browser, visit https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT. In the
   upper left corner, there is a **Fork** button. Please click on it to
   create a fork/copy of the repository on your profile.

- In a terminal, clone this repo by running the command where ``your-username``
  represents your Github username.

::

   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/FLINT/

- Enter into the newly created project folder by running this command.

::

   cd FLINT

- Configure upstream for the fork so that Git can sync work from the
  upstream if it is updated by running this command.

::

   git remote add upstream https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT/

- Check if upstream is configured by running the command and check if
  upstream is shown or not.

::

   git remote -v

- Make sure you've checked out the ``develop`` branch to be updated. It consists of all the latest changes
  for the FLINT Installation.

::

   git checkout develop

-  Now, the project is setup using Git. Please carry on with
   instructions on how to set this up on `Windows`_ or `Linux`_ here.
   You can revisit this section when you are ready to make a
   contribution.

Claim an issue
--------------

This section will demonstrate how to claim an issue.

To work on an issue, you must claim it by adding a request comment to
the issue thread and tagging a maintainer/issue triager in it.
You will be assigned to work on the issue now. Some additional notes:

-  You can only claim issues with the ``Good for newcomers`` or
   ``Help Wanted`` labels.
-  Please feel free to ask questions on how to approach the issue or if
   the tests are failing. The maintainers/reviewers will try to get back
   to you as soon as possible. You can reach us on the moja-global
   `slack`_, or through Github.
-  If your pull request has some requested changes, after working on it
   don't forget to leave a comment asking for a review since the
   reviewers aren't notified when a pull request is updated.



Make a contribution
-------------------

This section shows you step-by-step how to make a contribution to
FLINT using Git.

-  FLINT stable branch is **develop**. Releases are scheduled
   periodically when codebase is production-ready and the ``develop``
   branch is merged into the ``master`` branch.
