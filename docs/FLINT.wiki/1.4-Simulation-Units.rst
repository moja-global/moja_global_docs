**A Simulation Unit?**

A Simulation Unit is a unit for which a module is applied. A Simulation
Unit can represent a spatial area, such as a pixel or forest stand, or
it can represent an emissions source, such as livestock. Where the
Simulation Unit refers to a geographically referenced area, it is known
as a Land Unit.

**How  Simulation Units  are used in FLINT**

These are used within the databases and data-layers underpinned in FLINT. There are
attributed values that describe the characteristics of each Simulation
Unit. For example, for a Land Unit there may be information on the
unit’s area, land type, age of vegetation, species and carbon pools. The
overall framework of FLINT manages the processing of Simulation Units
over time. While Simulation Units are the basis of all simulations run
in FLINT, they are rarely used for reporting purposes (see Local
Domain).
