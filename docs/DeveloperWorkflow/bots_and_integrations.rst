Bots and Integrations
=====================

moja global makes use of an array of bots and integrations with GitHub
in order to provide a smooth experience to new contributors and to also
make the process of contributing as effortless as possible.

This section focuses on the bots used within the organization and how to
maintain them.

All-contributors Bot
--------------------

**All-contributors** bot is a `GitHub bot`_ to automate acknowledging
contributors to your open source projects. This is achieved by setting
up a contributors table in the readme which is edited according to the
commands given to our bot. This bot is created and maintained by the
all-contributors organisation `here`_.

**Usage**
~~~~~~~~~

\* **Add a contributor** : Comment on Issue or Pull Request, asking
@all-contributors to add a contributor: :

::

   @all-contributors please add <username> for <contributions>

   * <contribution> : See the `Emoji Key (Contribution Types Reference) <https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key>`_ for a list of valid contribution types.

-  **Intent-Based Bot** : Your request to the bot doesn't need to be
   perfect. The bot will use basic Natural Language Parsing to determine
   your intent. For example, this will work too:

::

   Jane you are crushing it in documentation and your infrastructure work has been great too. Let's
   add jane.doe23 for her contributions. cc @all-contributors``

-  The bot will then create a Pull Request to add the contributor, then
   reply with the pull request details.

Contributing
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to configure or modify the bot settings according to the
needs of the repository, you may update the ``.all-contributorsrc`` JSON
file. The data used to generate the contributors list will be stored in
there, and you can configure how you want ``@all-contributors`` to
generate the list. Here are more details on the `configuration options`_
available.

Prose Bot
--------------------
**ProseBot** is a `Github Bot <https://github.com/apps/prosebot/installations/new>`__. As changes are made to Markdown files (.md)
or text files (.txt) it runs various checks against them to give
feedback regarding the English. This bot is created and maintained by the prosebot ​organization
`here <https://github.com/prosebot/prosebot>`__.

**Usage**
~~~~~~~~~

Currently, the app runs the following checks:-

-  Correct spelling (and provides possible corrections).
-  Use of non-inclusive/profane/offensive language.
-  Various prose-related checks, find the full list `here <https://github.com/btford/write-good#checks>`__.

Here's how it looks in action:

   ProseBot WriteGood Check   

**Configuration**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently, the app tests your text using three providers. It uses these
providers primarily:-

-  `write-good`_
-  `alex`_
-  `node-spellchecker`_

They can all be disabled, and all are enabled by default. To disable a
provider, add a ``.github/write-good.yml``\ file to your repository and
set the provider to ``false``:-

.. code:: yml

   # .github/write-good.yml
   writeGood: true
   alex: true
   spellchecker: true

.. _write-good: https://github.com/btford/write-good
.. _alex: https://github.com/get-alex/alex
.. _node-spellchecker: https://github.com/atom/node-spellchecker


Stale Bot
--------------------

**Stale Bot** is a `Github Bot <https://github.com/apps/stale/installations/new>`__ 
built with `Probot <https://github.com/probot/probot>`__ that closes abandoned 
Issues and Pull Requests after a period of inactivity.This bot is created and maintained by the probot ​organization
`here <https://github.com/probot/stale>`__.

If the Issue or Pull Request is updated, or anyone comments, then the
stale label is removed.If no more activity occurs, the Issue or Pull Request will be
automatically closed with an optional comment.

      daysUntilStale: 60
      # Number of days of inactivity before an Issue or Pull Request with the stale label is closed.
      # Set to false to disable. If disabled, issues still need to be closed manually, but will remain marked as stale.
      daysUntilClose: 7
      # Only issues or pull requests with all of these labels are check if stale. Defaults to `[]` (disabled)
      onlyLabels: []
      # Issues or Pull Requests with these labels will never be considered stale. Set to `[]` to disable
      exemptLabels:
      - pinned

      recent activity. It will be closed if no further activity occurs. Thank you
      for your contributions.
      # Comment to post when removing the stale label.
      # unmarkComment: >

      # Comment to post when closing a stale Issue or Pull Request.
      # closeComment: >
      #   Your comment here.
      # Limit the number of actions per hour, from 1-30. Default is 30
      limitPerRun: 30
      # Limit to only `issues` or `pulls`
      # only: issues
      # Optionally, specify configuration settings that are specific to just 'issues' or 'pulls':
      # pulls:
      #   daysUntilStale: 30
      #   markComment: >
      #     This pull request has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had
      #     recent activity. It will be closed if no further activity occurs. Thank you
      #     for your contributions.
