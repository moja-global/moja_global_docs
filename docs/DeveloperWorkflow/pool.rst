Pools
=========

A pool is a reservoir within which something can be stored and released.
For example, a carbon pool is a reservoir from which carbon can be
stored or emitted, such as debris. FLINT assigns a value to each pool,
such as tonnes carbon, and at every time step, it can move stores from
one pool to another using operations.
