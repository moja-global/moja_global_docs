GitHub Workflow
###############

moja global as an Open source organisation wants to provide their users the best possible collaborative experience while meeting their security requirements and limiting their maintenance effort.
Working on a collaborative platform like GitHub at times can be  overwhelming, especially as the number of users and repositories grow within an organization.

This had led to the adoption of some GitHub workflow practices to ensure the smooth working of moja global. These practices include repository maintainance practices, automated checks for pull requests as well more advanced testing methodologies and bots to ease the workflow.
